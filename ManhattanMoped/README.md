This project allows the user to use commands through a CLI to drive a moped around Manhattan, one block at a time.

Implementation is simplified to a grid of 200 streets and 10 avenues. Specific locations cause advertisements to be displayed to the user.

This project was assigned as coursework for NYU's Object Oriented Programming course.
